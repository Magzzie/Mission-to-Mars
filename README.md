# Mission-to-Mars
Web Scraping with HTML / CSS

## Background

A junior data scientist, Robin, does freelance astronomy work in her spare time. <br>
Her dream is to land a position with NASA someday. So she spends a lot of time visiting sites with news about space exploration, especially the mission to Mars. <br>

One day, while reading an article about how much water the red planet may have had in its youth, she has an idea, 
what if she can write a script that would gather all the information she searches for into one convenient location, and once she gathered it, what if she can show it off to other Astrophiles. If it’s polished enough, it may even get NASA’s attention. <br>

Robin, has requested our help to gather data about the mission to Mars from all over the web and display it in a central location without spending her free time gathering the data manually. <br>

Instead, she has requested we build a web application: (ROBIN’S MARS DATABASE: Updates | Current Martian Weather | Water Info | Rover Locations), that will scrape new data every time she tells it to, with a click of a button. 



### Purpose

We intend to automate a web browser to visit different websites to extract data about the Mission to Mars. <br>
Then we will store it in a NoSQL database, and render the data in a web application created with Flask. <br>
The completed work will be displayed in your portfolio, which we will also create. <br>


## Objectives

1. Scrape Full-Resolution Mars Hemisphere Images and Titles
2. Update the Web App with Mars Hemisphere Images and Titles
3. Add Bootstrap 3 Components


## Resources
- Data Source:
- Software: 
- Libraries and Packages: 
- Online Tools: 


## Methods
Our analysis plan entailed the following: 
- Writing a Python script that can navigate the webpages to collect the right information.
- Once we had all the data, we needed a place to store it, such as a nonstructural database. <br>
Instead of using a SQL database with its structural rules, we would use a NoSQL database, MongoDB. Because the data pulled from the internet comes in many different forms; it’s not always in the neat and tidy tables that SQL requires. <br>
- Mongo was designed as a document-based database which suits ou needs a bit better since we would be downloading tables, but also paragraphs and images.<br>
